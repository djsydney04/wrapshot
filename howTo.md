Wrapshot Intelligence can automatically analyze your script to:

- Estimate shooting times

### Uploading Your Script

1. Navigate to your project
2. Go to the **Script** section in the sidebar
3. Click **Upload Script** or drag-and-drop your PDF

Keep track of revisions by uploading new script versions:
