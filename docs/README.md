# Documentation

Start here for how the repo is structured, how it boots, and where core APIs live.

## Docs Index

- docs/codebase.md: Repository structure and module boundaries
- docs/architecture.md: Module responsibilities, ownership, and integrations
- docs/load-map.md: Runtime load map (boot path, auth, data flow)
- docs/usage.md: Local development, scripts, and common workflows
- docs/api.md: API routes and request/response contracts
- docs/setup.md: Full setup and environment configuration
- docs/implementation-guides/finance.md: Finance module implementation guide
- docs/finance-flow.md: Finance UX flow and design intent

## Conventions

- Keep feature-specific guides in `docs/implementation-guides/`
- Keep root README focused on onboarding; deeper details belong here
- Prefer adding new docs in `docs/` with short, stable filenames
